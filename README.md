# Face Emotion Detection

A Python project for real‑time facial emotion recognition using computer vision and deep learning.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository implements a system that:

* Captures a live video stream from a webcam
* Detects human faces in real time
* Classifies facial expressions into emotion categories (e.g., Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral, Disgust, Fear)
* Displays detected faces and predicted emotions overlayed on video frames

---

## 📦 Features

* Face detection using **OpenCV Haar cascades**
* Emotion recognition using a **convolutional neural network** trained on a standard facial emotion dataset (e.g. FER‑2013)
* Real‑time inference with webcam input
* Optionally supports static image or video processing
* Optional training pipeline (if training code is included)

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dipta19062021/faceemotiondetection.git
   cd faceemotiondetection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Typical dependencies:

   * `opencv-python`
   * `tensorflow` or `keras`
   * `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
   * (Optional) `deepface`, `streamlit`, etc.

4. Download any necessary model files (e.g. `.h5`, `.xml`) as per project directory structure.

## 🧠 Usage

### Run real‑time emotion detection:

```bash
python emotion_detection.py
```

* Webcam feed will launch
* Detected faces and predicted emotions will be overlayed in real time

### Process a static image:

```bash
python emotion_detection.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

### Train your own model (if implemented):

```bash
python train_model.py --dataset dataset_folder/
```

## 📈 Supported Emotions

The model predicts one of the following seven categories (based on Ekman’s universal emotions):
**Angry**, **Disgust**, **Fear**, **Happy**, **Sad**, **Surprise**, **Neutral** ([GitHub][1], [GitHub][2], [Wikipedia][3], [Wikipedia][4], [GitHub][5], [GitHub][6])

## 🧩 Acknowledgments & References

* FER‑2013 dataset (Kaggle) used for model training
* Inspired by open‑source works like real‑time facial emotion detection implementations using OpenCV and DeepFace ([GitHub][1])
* Methodology based on standard facial emotion recognition literature ([GitHub][1])

---

## 📌 Tips & Troubleshooting

* Make sure your system has a working webcam and compatible OpenCV version
* Ensure the Haar cascade XML file is located correctly relative to the script
* If using DeepFace or similar libraries, your GPU drivers and TensorFlow compatibility may affect performance
* Lighting and webcam quality can impact detection accuracy

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

* Support video file input and output
* Switchable backends (e.g. DeepFace, MediaPipe, MTCNN)
* Web or GUI interface using Streamlit, PyQt, or Flask
* Integration of audio emotion detection for multimodal analysis
